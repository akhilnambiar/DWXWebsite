created a website for DWX using Django, JQuery and Javascript. Worked constantly with my client in scoping which features would be most valueable. This website requires no CS experience to maintain which was one of the biggest criteria for the project. I also did all the design work for it. For security reasons, I haven't posted the website, but you can visit at dwx.berkeley.edu/dwxwebprod/home
